# Quadrature_Oscillator
Quadrature Down-conversion is common in todayâ€™s world
and has wide applications in interference mitigation [1] and
helps in improving the quality of communication in wireless
communication. The aim is to convert a signal of some given
high frequency, to a lower frequency signal.

The components used in our model of QDC are 

(a) Quadrature Oscillator 

(b) Mixer 

(c) RC Low-Pass Filter. 

The
goal of this project is to realize such a QDC and analyze its
working, simulations and applications in real life.
